## About
I am a motivated **software developer** seeking to expand my technical skill set and work on interesting projects. I love collaborative workplaces and have experience leading development on small interdisciplinary teams.

I have extensive experience using **Python** for web applications, APIs, bioinformatics tools, and production packaging. I strive for well-tested and elegant code. I am adept at developing and managing DevOps on **AWS** cloud infrastructure.

I graduated *summa cum laude* from Colby College in 2016 with a degree in computational biology. Immediately after graduation, I started working in the [Park Lab](https://compbio.hms.harvard.edu/people/carl-vitzthum-0) at Harvard Medical School. While there, I fully transitioned from science to software and haven't looked back. While at Harvard, I earned a Graduate Certificate in Data Science from the Harvard Extension school.

## Work Experience
For the past three and a half years, I have worked on the 4DN-DCIC in the Park Lab at Harvard Medical School. Over my time there, I was promoted multiple times and tasked with leading back-end development and DevOps for the team. Please [see my resume](https://github.com/carlvitzthum/carlvitzthum.github.io/raw/master/img/resume_1_5_20.pdf) for more details.

Before working at Harvard, I was a Research Fellow at the competitive Summer Student Program at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, ME. There I worked on identifying enriched variants associated with Alzheimer's disease. As part of my project, I adapted a web application to view these variants.

In college, I graded and tutored for the introductory computer science course at Colby College (2014 - 2016). I was also a research assistant for a concussion diagnosis project at Colby (2012 - 2014). Before that, I spent summers working as a molecular biology research assistant at Norwich University (2011 - 2013).

## Publications
I have accumulated a number of co-authorships on peer-reviewed publications over my years in academia. Although all of my recent work has been software engineering, I studied computational biology and a wide range of science and started at HMS as a Scientific Programmer. Before that, I worked in three different labs over my time in college and high school.

## Personal Interests
Outside of the workplace, I am an avid Ultimate Frisbee player. I have played on BUDA club teams since arriving in Boston, and most recently co-captained a team that won 1st place in the Fall 2019 tournament.

I am also interested in fitness and weight lifting. The intersection of software and fitness appeals to me, and some day I hope to apply my engineering and data science knowledge to make a product that can be used to help people get the most out of the gym.

Board games and strategy video games are also a passion of mine, so on the side I spend time playing and designing those. I am a formidable opponent in Settlers of Catan or Dominion. I also anticipate spending a lot of time on the remastered Warcraft III: Reforged when it comes out.
