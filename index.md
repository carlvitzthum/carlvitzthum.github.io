## Publications

I have accumulated a number of co-authorships on peer-reviewed publications over my years in academia. I studied computational biology and a wide range of science, which led to my first job at Harvard Medical School as a Scientific Programmer. Before that, I worked in three different labs over my undergraduate and high school career.
